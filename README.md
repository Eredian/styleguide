Coveo UI StyleGuide
===================

Coveo StyleGuide is a collection of UI components used in Coveo's Cloud Services administration console. All components and their documentation is available at : http://wfortin.github.io/StyleGuide/index.html

It is widely inspired by [Bootstrap 3.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and borrows some of it components.

The project is at it's early stages, some components can still have _lots_ of breaking changes.
